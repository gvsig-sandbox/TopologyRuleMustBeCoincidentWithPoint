# TopologyRuleMustBeCoincidentWithPoint
This rule is useful when the points must be aligned. 
Points in one layer must be coincident with points in another layer,  if are not coincident a report of points error is created, this report is composed by the points from the first layer that are not covered by points from the second layer.
